# covtest
judge the judge

it's a simple testsuite to test the code-coverage tools. the file titled testFuncs1.c includes the test functions.
all funcitons have their own comments which explained what is being tested and what would the result indicate.
for tools that generate the test harness only testFuncs1.c ad testFuncs1.h are required. for tools that don't generate the test harness
themselves, harness.c acts like a very simple harness.
